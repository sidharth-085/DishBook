**API Used:** https://www.themealdb.com/api.php






## Tech Stack

- **Navigation component** : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

- **Retrofit** : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.

- **Room** : Save meals in local database.

- **MVVM & LiveData** : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

- **Coroutines** : do some code in the background.

- **view binding** : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

- **Glide** : Catch images and load them in imageView.
