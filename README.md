## Tech Stack

- **Navigation component** : One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.

- **Retrofit** : Making HTTP connection with the REST API and converting meal JSON file to Kotlin/Java object.

- **Room** : Save meals in the local database.

- **MVVM & LiveData** : Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

- **Coroutines** : Do some code in the background.

- **View Binding** : Instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

- **Glide** : Catch images and load them in imageView.
